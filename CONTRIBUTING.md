# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this template. Contributions keep the project healthy and useful for others. Please follow the guidelines below to make the process smooth.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a descriptive branch (e.g., `feat/add-auth-example`, `fix/build-script`).
2. Make changes in your branch and keep commits focused and atomic.
3. Run tests and linters locally before pushing.
4. Open a Pull Request against `main` with a clear title and description.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] PR targets the `main` branch (or other branch described in the issue)
- [ ] The change is focused and described clearly in the PR description
- [ ] All existing tests pass and new tests are added for new behavior where applicable
- [ ] Linting and formatting applied (run `npm run lint` / `npm run format` if configured)
- [ ] No sensitive data or secrets are included

## Branch & Commit Conventions

- Branches: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`
- Commits: Keep messages short and meaningful. Use present-tense, e.g. `Add CI config`.

## Code Style & Tests

Follow the code style already present in the repo. If the project has linters or formatters configured, run them before submitting. Add unit tests for new logic where applicable.

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue if you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to discuss a non-trivial change. Provide steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details.
